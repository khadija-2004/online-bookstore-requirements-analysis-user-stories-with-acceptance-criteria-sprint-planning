# online-bookstore-requirements-analysis,-user-stories-with-acceptance-criteria,-sprint-planning

This project presents a complete **Requirement Analysis and User Story documentation** for an **Online Bookstore system**, designed from a client's perspective using software engineering best practices.

The focus of this project is on understanding user needs, translating them into clear functional and non-functional requirements, and defining detailed user stories with acceptance criteria to support development and testing.

## Project Overview
The client requires an **Online Bookstore** that allows users to:
- Browse and search books easily
- Manage user accounts securely
- Purchase books using secure payment methods
- Track orders and manage wishlists
- Receive personalized book recommendations

The system is designed to be **user-friendly, secure, scalable, and performance-efficient** across modern browsers and devices.

## Scope of Work
This project covers:
- Requirement refinement
- Functional requirements 
- Non-functional requirements
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Sprint planning for testing
- 
## Functional Features Covered
- User registration, login, logout, and password management  
- Browsing books by categories (genre, age group, bestsellers, new arrivals)  
- Advanced search (title, author, genre, ISBN) with filters  
- Shopping cart management (add, update, remove, view)  
- Secure checkout with multiple payment methods  
- Order history viewing and shipment tracking  
- Wishlist management  
- Personalized book recommendations  

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**  
  - Search results ≤ 2 seconds  
  - Checkout completion ≤ 5 seconds  

- **Usability:**  
  - Intuitive navigation and clear UI labels  

- **Security:**  
  - Encrypted transactions  
  - Restricted checkout access for authenticated users  

- **Compatibility:**  
  - Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (desktop & mobile)  

- **Reliability & Scalability:**  
  - Handles concurrent users without degradation  

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
Each major feature is documented using:
- Gherkin-style scenarios (Given / When / Then)
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Coverage of positive user flows and edge cases  

Examples include:
- Browse books by category  
- Search with filters  
- Account management workflows  
- Cart and checkout operations  
- Order tracking and recommendations  

## Sprint Planning
Agile-based sprint planning for testing is included, divided into **three sprints**:

### Sprint 1
- Browsing and searching
- Account creation, login, logout

### Sprint 2
- Password management
- Shopping cart functionality

### Sprint 3
- Checkout & payment
- Order tracking
- Wishlist & recommendations

Each sprint includes priority, estimation, and timelines.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Requirement Engineering  
- User Story Writing  
- Acceptance Criteria Definition  
- Agile & Sprint Planning  
- System Analysis  
- Software Documentation
